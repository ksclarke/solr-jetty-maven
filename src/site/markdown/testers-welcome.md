## Testers Welcome

There are many ways to contribute to an open source project.  One way is to download the project, run it, and report back with any issues you encounter.  This helps developers improve the project by surfacing bugs and other areas for improvement (either in the documentation, the user interface, or the code itself).  You don't have to be a programmer to download and run a project.  In fact, having non-programmers give a project a test run will often surface issues that programmers are likely to overlook.

## Report an Issue

If you do discover an area of the project that could use some improvement, please <a href="https://github.com/ksclarke/solr-jetty-maven/issues" title="Issues" target="_blank">file a ticket</a>.  This will alert the developer(s) to the issue.  When reporting an issue, try to be as specific as you can.  It's helpful if you can provide a series of steps that developers can follow to reproduce the issue you're reporting.  Any issue report, though, is useful.

## Coders Are Welcome, Too

If you are testing out the project and have programming experience, patches are of course also welcome.  See the [Coders Welcome](coders-welcome.html "Coder's Welcome") page for more details about how to contribute in this way.
