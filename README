solr-jetty-maven
=================================================================================

A Solr project that runs in a Jetty/Maven context. It's been tested with Maven 3.


=================================================================================
Introduction
=================================================================================

To start a standalone (or master) Solr instance, type:
  mvn process-resources jetty:run

To start a slave Solr instance:
  1) Edit the <master.solr.url> element in the pom.xml to point to the master
  2) Then, type: mvn -Denv.type=slave process-resources jetty:run

To use Solr's administrative / dashboard UI, go to: http://localhost:8983/#/

To configure a Solr master or slave instance, look at the configuration in the
project's pom.xml profiles section.  Those values can be overridden in a Maven
settings.xml file found at either:

  $M2_HOME/conf/settings.xml
  ${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml

Note that, currently, running:

  mvn clean

will "clean" (i.e., delete) the Solr workspace (index, snapshots, etc.)


=================================================================================
Replication Options
=================================================================================

For a first pass, this is still configured to do replication in the older > 1.4
version style (which uses polling).  With the release of version 4.0, there is a
new method for replication, SolrCloud (which uses pushes).  I will look into this
new method and see what needs to be done in Maven.
